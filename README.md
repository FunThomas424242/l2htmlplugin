L2HTMLPlugin
============

Lineage 2 HTML Eclipse plugin
-----------------------------
L2HTMLPlugin is an Eclipse plugin for Eclipse 4+, which allows an easier creation and preview of L2-HTML pages. L2HTML means "Lineage 2 HTML" and describes the HTML files, which are bundled with a Lineage 2 gameserver (e.g. L2J). You can find out more about L2J on: http://www.l2jserver.com/.

Motivation
----------
Every L2(J)-Developer knows the pain of not being able to preview the HTML-pages straightaway in a window resembling the usual NpcHtmlMessage-window or the community-board.

L2HTMLPlugin aims to fill this gap. Once you are done with the L2-HTML, you can click the preview-tab and see how the L2-HTML-page would look in the corresponding dialog(s).

This is the first of several goals for this plugin.
